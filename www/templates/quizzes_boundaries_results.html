					<br>Your boundaries are firm, like cement. You reserve your energy for things that matter the most to you. You prefer to have a plan and struggle when the plan shifts. Friends think of you as reliable, but a little rigid. Pick 1-3 categories where your US would be helped in you becoming more flexible in your boundaries. What are 3 ways you can move in that direction?</div>

					<br>Your boundaries go wherever the wind takes you or the moon pulls you. You spend your energy freely, blessing others as you go, but sometimes forgetting yourself or those closest to you. Friends think of you as fun, but a little unreliable. Pick 1-3 categories where your US would be helped in you becoming more grounded in your boundaries. What are 3 ways you can move in that direction?</div>

					<br>Hey, nicely done. Your boundaries are crystal clear, but not immovable. You're good at protecting your time and resources, while allowing room for spontaneity based on the moment, the person, or the ask. Your friends think of you as principled and kind-hearted. Pick 1 category where you have grown the most in balanced boundaries. Share with your spouse what you think caused this shift.</div>
